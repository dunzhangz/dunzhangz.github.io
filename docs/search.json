Follow “Quickstart” section, “Building a Blogging Website” section, and “Publishing a Website on Github Pages” section.\nNote that Quarto is recommended for users who are familiar with Python and Markdown language written in Jupyter Notebooks.\nEverything is recommended to be done in a new enviroment other than the base (boot) environment.\nAlthough some dynamic logic functions are supported in Quarto, I do not recommend to use since many minor problems exist which may frustrate you. Just regard this website as a static website.\n\nI will not provide detailed instructions on how to use Quarto here, as it is well documented in the official website. Instead, I will provide a few commonly used syntaxes in daily posting after I have built this blogging website.\nEvery new post should be named index.ipynb stored in a new directory under the posts directory. At the top of each post, there is a YAML header that contains metadata about the post, such as title, date, and tags, that is in the following format:\n\n---\ntitle: \"How to build a simple static blogging website like this!\"\nauthor: \"Dun Zhang\"\ndate: \"2025-06-19\"\ncategories: [Quick Start]\njupyter: python3\n---\n\nSome commonly used commands are\n\nquarto render\nquarto render --execute\nquarto preview"

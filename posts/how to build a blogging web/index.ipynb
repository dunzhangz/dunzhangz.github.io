    "## Why building a blogging website?\n",
    "- Knowledge understanding is further enhanced by writing.\n",
    "- Sharing knowledge with others is a great way to help them.\n",
    "- Absolute control of my website is guaranteed.\n",
    "- Websites are accessible as long as one has a browser and internet connection. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of how this website is built\n",
    "- All the content of this website is written with Python and Markdown language in Jupyter Notebooks using .ipynb file.\n",
    "- Notebook files are converted to HTML using Quarto.\n",
    "- HTML files are hosted in Github Pages (a static web server).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tips\n",
    "- Quarto is recommended by fast.ai. Everyhing is just so easy with Quarto.\n",
    "- Go to the official website of [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) to learn how to use it. Follow \"Quickstart\" section, \"Building a Blogging Website\" section, and \"Publishing a Website on Github Pages\" section. \n",
    "- Note that Quarto is recommended for users who are familiar with Python and Markdown language written in Jupyter Notebooks.\n",
    "- Everything is recommended to be done in a new enviroment other than the base (boot) environment.\n",
    "- Although some dynamic logic functions are supported in Quarto, I do not recommend to use since many minor problems exist which may frustrate you. Just regard this website as a static website.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will not provide detailed instructions on how to use Quarto here, as it is well documented in the official website. Instead, I will provide a few commonly used syntaxes in daily posting after I have built this blogging website.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every new post should be named `index.ipynb` stored in a new directory under the `posts` directory. At the top of each post, there is a YAML header that contains metadata about the post, such as title, date, and tags, that is in the following format:"
